<h3>WHAT IS GRAPHIC DESIGN?</h3>


Graphic design is simply the act of creating and sharing a meaningful thought, information or message with visuals and elements as images, colors, text, shapes etc.


      <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Graphics Design As A Communication Tool.</h2>

<p>Graphic Design is a strong communication tool as it reaches out to pass across an information to viewers.
Think about the flyers you see that informs you of an event.</p>
<p>Think about the banners, logos, magazines and designs that informs you of the values and identity of a business.
All these come together to pass relevant information to viewers. They speak loudly even when you fail to speak.</p>
<p>Imagine the effect a business card has on a business.
Imagine why a business owner will print a business card and hand it over to prospective client even without uttering a word.</p>
The card speaks on his behalf.
<P>So graphic design is a voice that communicates a clear message to viewers.
If your graphics fails to achieve this, then you have failed as a designer.</p>

      <h6 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">The Concept Of Graphics Designing</h6>
<p>Just as the name implies, graphic design has two parts,    <b> Graphics and design</b> These two comes together to give you the result you need.</p>
<strong>GRAPHIC</strong> is visual, this has to do with imagination and expression involving many mediums such as drawing, painting or lettering giving a clear and explicit detail.
<p>So basically graphic has to do with visual elements that are assembled to pass a message.
The elements you can view as regarded as the graphics part of this subject.</p>
<b>Graphics design is the organization and presentation of information developed through a creative process.</b>
<p>Take away creativity from graphics and it loses its taste.

Creativity is vitally important.  In all your getting, get it. Or rather activate it.</p>

      <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Part Two</h2>

<H5>WHO IS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER?</H5>
<p>The above question has received little or no correct answer over time. Many have taken up the tag of graphic designer without meriting it.
Graphic designing goes beyond putting text and colors together. So if all you can do is just to add text to color, then you are not a graphic designer.</p>
<p>A graphic designers is any one who goes through the creative process to present information leveraging on visual elements.
</p>
<i>This definition might sound big.</i>
<p>A graphic designer simply put is a creator who uses visible elements to create his ideas and communicate with an audience.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE :</strong> A design is incomplete if it doesn't clearly pass an information or relate an idea to viewers.</p>
<p>This is the difference between self acclaimed graphic designers and real graphic designers.</p>
<p>A graphic designer can explain the process and every element present in a design. He or she can give reasons for the choice of color, font, image, etc.</P>
</p>A graphic designer is that person who has the ability to turn your ideas into visual content that appeals.</p>
<P><b>A graphic designer is not a person who can use a design tool, but one who understand the functions of this tools and effectively use them to visualize thought and birth ideas.</b></P>
<p>A graphic designer is one who can capture words, bring out their true meaning in visual form.</p>
<p> As a graphic designer you don't just create a design to appeal to the eyes. You create designs to pass the intended information.</p>
<P>If your audience misunderstands your design, then you have failed as a graphic designer.</p>
<P>A graphic designer is one who respects process and embraces design growth.</p>
<p>There are no perfect designers. We only have good designers who obey design principles.</p>
<p>To become a better designer, get good knowledge of the process and necessary tools and utilize them effectively without bias.</p>
<p>The graphic design world is a filled with creativity and only those who activates their creative mind will successfully produce good designs.</p>
      <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Part  Three</h2>

<h5>WHAT EVERY GRAPHICR DESIGNER MUST KNOW</h5>
<p>Graphic designers are Creative and you can only identify with them if you operate in that realm.</p>
<p>You cannot be a graphic designer and fail to activate creativity.</P>
<p><strong>There are some simple thoughts every graphic designers must have and actions every graphic designer must take to consistent become better in designs.</strong></p>
<h5>1</h5>
<p><b>You are a creator.</b></p>
<p>It is necessary you see yourself in the mode of a creator.
As a designer, you bring to life words and thoughts to reality where the eyes can see and understand better.
God said, "Let there be light and there was light". On that screen, a designer says let there be a logo and he starts moulding until he gets a beautiful logo.</P>
<p> Just imagine opening the interface of your design app. You either meet a white, black or any blank interface.
At that point nothing can be seen. It is just like when the world was without form and void and the spirit of God moved around the face of the deep.
The first stroke you make on the screen represents the first statement God made, "Let there be light"</p>
<p>You keep on adding different elements until you will look at your work and you will nod and say, <i>"IT IS GOOD"</i></P>
<h5>2</h5>
<p><b>You work with principles and rules</b></P>
<p>Good graphic designers don't abuse freedom. Even with the knowledge that you are in charge and you have the liberty to exercise your creative freedom.</p>
<p>You should also remember you have some restrictions and allow it to guide you.</P>
<p>This means that you shouldn't be carried away by the razzmatazz and destroy your designs.
Following the rules makes your work acceptable in the design world.</p>
<p>This is why you can post a flyer design and the world will celebrate you, but a fellow graphic designer will quickly spot out errors and inform you.
Your designs should pass a fire test. If fellow designers says it is good, then you are good to go.
But this can only happen when you play according to the rule.</p>
 <h5>3</h5> 
<p><b>You must explore your tools well</b></P>
<p>We have graphic design tools and a good knowledge of how to use them helps you create awesome designs.
One of your desire as a designer should be to get a good knowledge of how to utilize the tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>There are so much to learn about the tools used for designing graphics and you should be willing to learn them.
Don't limit yourself to the ones you already know. Always strive to try out new tools. You will be glad you did.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p><b> There are no perfect designs</b></p>
<p>During my beginner stage, I ones created a flyer and I went on personal celebration. I was so proud of myself. I couldn't sleep well that night as I kept on viewing the design and smiling.
The next day I woke up, quickly sent the design to a senior colleague for vetting. I wasn't expecting any correction.</p>
<p>The first thing he asked me was, "have you posted this flyer anywhere?"
When I said <b>NO</b>
He replied, <b>"Thank God."</b></p>
<p>That was when I knew I had messed up.
After his correction, I was left in tears.</P>
<P>You can't be perfect as a graphic designer, always create space for corrections.
Don't be too sure of your design to a point that you pick offense at corrections especially when it is coming from a senior colleague in the design world.</p>
<h5>5</h5>
<p><b>Practice brings improvement</b></p>
<p>Make designing your hobby. Do it at your leisure.
Instead of engaging in some unnecessary chats and discussions. You can try out designs.
Keep on practicing. Improve on your previous works.</P>
<p>Just like in school, if you leave your book for long, you will lose track of some knowledge in it.
If you fail to practice you will. Struggle to improve.</P>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>There is no glory in practice, but without practice, there will be no glory</p>
                      <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Part Four</h2>
<h2>DO'S AND DON'TS OF GRAPHIC DESIGNS</h2>
<P></P>The quest to produce amazing and good looking graphics works against many graphic designers.
Your desire to translate every picture in your mind makes many designs awful.</P>
<P></P>Imagine a good soup without salt. Even with the presence of the meat, fish and other ingredients in large quantity. I bet you will notice the absence of salt.</P>
<P></P>Just like a chef will hate himself if he fails to add salt to his food, that is how a graphic designer feels if he neglect certain design necessities.
The flip side of it is that if you put the salt in excess, you will still regret it.
So there should be a moderation.</P>
 <P></P>In this unit, we will be looking at the things a graphic designer is permitted to do and those thing he or she is prohibited from doing.</p>
<H5>DO</H5>  Use clean and modern fonts.
You are permitted to use one typeface and 2 or 3 variation of fonts.
<h5>DON'T</h5> <P>use too many fonts in one design</P>.
<P>This is one of the major problem of many designers. Too much fonts distracts your viewer and makes them lose interest.
  Maintain 2 or 3 fonts maximum in a design.</P>
<H5>DO</H5> <P>Add images into your designs</P>.
<P>The images most times stands out and grabs  attention. Images are good elements that help express your thoughts</P>
<H5>DON'T</H5> <P>overload your design with too many images. Numerous images in one design hurts the clarity of your message
  Viewers gets confused as in most cases, the images might contradict one another.</P>
<H5>DO</H5> <P></P>Use stock photos.</P>
<P>Stock photos are quality photos stored in different sites by profession photographers and designers.
  These are ready to use photos that helps you easily pass your message. Ensure you get quality one with high pixels.
  </P>
<H5>DON'T</H5> <P>use Google images.</P>
<P>I know you are surprised to see this as you might be acquainted to Google as a source of all answers.
  Google images most times comes out in low qualities and thus might not be good for designs.
  If you must use Google images. Ensure you add HD at the end of your search. E.g  Picture of a flower vase HD.
  Make sure you select a bright and quality image.</P>
<H5>DO</H5> <P>Use more stylized fonts.</P>
<P>Amongst the 3 fonts ensure you use catchy fonts. Do this with caution. Don't be too playful with your font selection.
  Used styled font that is readable and connect to the message. Don't use a bloody font for a birthday flyer.</P>
<H5>DON'T</H5> <p>use comic sand or crazy fonts that makes your text unclear and hard to read.
  I'm sure you wouldn't want people to see you as a joker.
  Avoid fonts that contradicts your message.</p>
<H5>DO</H5> <P>check out for latest design trends.</P>
<P>Don't be stuck to your old pattern of design. Designs evolve, so the designer should evolve too.
  What is trending? What is reigning? Find out. As a designer you ought to be up-to-date.
  Don't continue is the coloring pattern, search for latest design pattern and explore.
  You can find inspiration from other designer's work.</P>
<H5>DO</H5> <P>Don't steal other designers work.You can model a designer, but don't steal.
  You can use a design pattern, make changes like color, images, text etc. Add your creative spice and boom come out with something lovely.
  </P>
</H2>Note</H2><P> As a beginner, don't start any design from your head. Always look for a design and model it. Google is your friend.
</P>
 <H5>DO</H5> <P>take time to choose your color.</P>
<P>Subsequently we will be treating color psychology. Don't just fill your design with color that catches your fancy.
  Every color has an emotion it projects. Some colors contradicts. A good knowledge of color choice makes a big difference.
  Spend more time choosing colors and give them the attention they need.
  The importance of color cannot be overemphasized.  So watch out for it.
  </P>
<H5>DON'T</H5> <P>Don't use too many colors in a design. You are permitted to use maximum of 3 colors</P>.
<P>Don't fill your design with so many primary colors or colors that don't work together.
  If you understand color combination. You will create better graphics.</P>
